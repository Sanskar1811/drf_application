The title of the project is Invoice API's Integration using Django Rest Framework .
In this project, I have created 2 models one for Invoice and another for InvoiceDetail where there is relationship between 2 models if Invoice is deleted , the Invoice details of that 
particular customer will automatically deleted. The api support all type of HTTP methods like GET , POST , PUT and DELETE. The API also accepts invoice_details in the payload and create/update the associated invoice details.
I also implement all the test cases to test all the endpoints successfully.
